# Obsidian Conflict: Insanity Difficulty
The release of Obsidian Conflict is near! (Unless...?) This repository is kind of a practice to make campaigns much harder by multiplying the enemy NPC stats by three, preventing people from rushing maps, and forcing them to co-op together on the XP server. This mod is kind of practice and can be changed when Obsidian Conflict for Steam comes out!

# Recommended Settings
* Set the Lives setting to `1` so people don't get respawned when killed, and game over when failed. This encourages users to be more cooperative rather than trying to rush towards the goal.
> If the Lives settings are too harsh, you could try enabling the Lives setting when there are enough players.

# How to install?
Put the `oc_insanity_difficulty` into `sourcemods/obsidian/add-ons` folder.
