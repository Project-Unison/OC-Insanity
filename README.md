# Obsidian Conflict: Realism
Obsidian Conflict is near! This repository is kinda a practice to make campaigns much realism, preventing people to rushing maps and forcing to co-op together for XP server. This mod is kinda practice and can be changed when Obsidian Conflict for Steam comes out!

# Recommended Settings
* Set Lives setting to one-live, so people doesn't get respawned when killed. This encourages users to be more cooperative rather than trying to rush towards to the goal.
